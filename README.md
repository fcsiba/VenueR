## Problem Statament
There is so much space around us, that is underutilized, such as Meeting room, sitting idle when there is no meeting scheduled. So Many sport grounds that that are underutilized when there is no tournament. With Covid-19 changing the world so rapidly, the events are now conducted in a different way. For example, the home lawns that were previously not utilized, have been rapidly used for small gatherings such as weddings and other religious events
### Introduction
Our Online web-based portal connects the space renters to rentiers and also links them to provide a complete solution in one place. This can give underutilized spaces a way of earning and a cost-effective way of carrying out any event. Some events need smaller spaces than wedding halls thus our search based on number of guest accommodation can cater to that and once again in a cost-effective way.
With so many events taking place throughout the year the cost of these functions can be optimized if the space can be rented online at your desired location as well as creating an opportunity to earn for those who have big spaces not in use. 
## Objective
Give a public platform for people to showcase their spaces that needs to be rented by creating a profile that can be added to the database. 
Rentiers can search space according to type, price and accommodation space based on their interest

People can select event space based on rating and reviews as the database grows the system can become more reliable.
